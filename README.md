## What is it?

This is a very simple library for creating and running state machines. I created this to hopefully save myself some typing, but also to learn about publishing code and unit testing

### Maven
If you use maven, you can pull this package in from jitpack.  First, add jitpack to your repositories section:
````
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
````
Next, add to your dependencies section. Replace the version number to whatever the latest release is.
````
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.Jaiming724</groupId>
	    <artifactId>SimpleStateMachine</artifactId>
	    <version>1.0.1</version>
	</dependency>
````

## To Do
* Add Unit Testing
* Better Error Handling
* CI/CD
